# Messier Tracker

A simple app for logging observations of the various **Messier objects**.

More information about Messier objects can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object).

This app allows you to view, add, edit and delete log entries for each of the Messier objects. It also displays a small amount of information about each object such as its [Apparent Magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude), the type of object ([Globular Clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster), [Supernova Remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant), etc).

Currently, there is no kind of user authentication. Data is just stored in session cookies. Eventually, this app will store log entries in a database with legitimate user authentication.

It will also eventually look nicer as I have only applied minimal styling so far.

Another feature I plan to eventually include is a way to view where each Messier object is located in relation to other stars and maybe a real time description of where it can be found for a given viewing location.
